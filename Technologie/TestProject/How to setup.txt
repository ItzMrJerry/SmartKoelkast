It seems like the --host flag is not available for binding to a specific IP, but there is an environment variable you can set instead, OLLAMA_HOST, to specify the IP address that Ollama should listen on.

Solution:
You can try setting the OLLAMA_HOST environment variable to 0.0.0.0, which will allow Ollama to listen on all available network interfaces (including your local network IP).

Steps:
Open a terminal or command prompt.

Set the environment variable:

On Windows:

bash
Copy code
set OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434
After setting this variable, start Ollama:

bash
Copy code
ollama serve
This should bind Ollama to all network interfaces, making it accessible from other devices on the network (including your Raspberry Pi).

Testing:
On your laptop, you can now test if the server is running with the following curl command:

bash
Copy code
curl http://192.168.137.1:11434/api/generate -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"prompt": "Hello, Ollama!"}'
On your Raspberry Pi, use the same command to send a request to your laptop's IP.
